# TestAutomationFlutterGallery
Take Home Test for QA Engineer in Fita

How to run the tests:
1. please run appium server first
2. set UDID in general.java with your device
3. run as TestNG - I'm using maven, appium, testNG

How I setup the structure to fit automated test:
- I made the object repository (OR.properties)
- I supposed made 2 scenarios: login and checkout. They are independent for each other and I will call them in regression test.
But I had problem to pick some element, as you can see on my code, I tried with UIScrollable/ entering webview context/others but still they didn't work.
- So I'm sorry for deliver unfinished project. Thank you for the opportunity, this is my first time to make Automation using Flatter apps.

and Have a nice day :)
